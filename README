> To install:
	-> goto INSTALL

> To link programs with it:
	g++ <options and files> -lneural++

- Note: because of iconv link bug on OSX, on this system you have to link like that:
      	g++ <options and files> -liconv -lneural++

> HOWTO:
	# Take a look to the example in "examples" directory in the source package, in
	  $PREFIX/share/neural++ or at http://blacklight.gotdns.org/prog/neuralpp/examples .
	
	# Take a look to the example in "doc" directory in the source package, in
	  $PREFIX/share/neural++ or at http://blackligtht.gotdns.org/prog/neuralpp/doc/index.html.
	  You can also generate the documentation on your own moving to include/
	  directory in the source package and typing `doxygen`, if you've got doxygen
	  installed.
