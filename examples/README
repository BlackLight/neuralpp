This directory contains some sources to illustrate LibNeural++ usage.
learnAdd is a source training a neural network to do simple sums
between two integer positive numbers. The network is then saved to a
binary file called "adder.net". This file can then be used by "doAdd".
In this program you're asked input numbers to the network, and then
the output is given. If executable files would not be present, type
`make` to create them.

Of course, you must have Neural++ already installed before typing `make`
